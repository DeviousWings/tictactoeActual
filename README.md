## Play TicTacToe

This game was a project from Programming with Classes CSE 210 class.

I had to implement what I learned over the 7 weeks of studying Python principles.  

This included Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Maintainability.

## What I learned
I learned a lot about how to get code to interact with each other across different files. Also learned what doesnâ€™t work and make an infinite loop of imports.

## Getting Started
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. Open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.
```
python3 main.py 
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and click the "run" icon.

## Project Structure
The project files and folders are organized as follows:
```
root                    (project root folder)
+-- TicTacToeActual     (source code for game)
  +-- game              (specific classes)
  +-- main.py           (program entry point)
+-- README.md           (general info)
```
